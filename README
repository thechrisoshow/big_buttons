Big Buttons
===========

Big Buttons is an iPhone app that lets you control your Mac with your iPhone.  It does this by calling scripted commands on your personal server.

Find out more about the App here: http://bigbuttonsapp.com

All of the scripted commands are just plain old Applescript.  So if you can write Applescript you can create your own buttons.

I've also included the PSDs of the button icons, so you can see the dimensions and copy the graphics for your own buttons.

Please let me know if you create any truly awesome buttons, and I'll merge the code in here and include them in the next update of Big Buttons.
